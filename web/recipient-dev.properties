#This file is used for bootstrapping Recipient[s] and configuring names and addresses to these.

# Lines with the prefix: recipient are used to create Recipient objects
# It is made up of the following parts:
# recipient.[ID].[name] = xxx
# recipient.[ID].[logicalAddress] = xxx
# recipient.[ID].[certificateType] = xxx
# [ID] is the Id of the Receiver object (at this point a non-existing Receiver object)
# [name] is the pretty print name for this recipient
# [logicalAddress] is the address that is to be used for sending certificates
# [certificateType] is the type of the certificate

# Defines the recipient FK (F\u00F6rs\u00E4kringskassan)
# Logical address for FK (via NTjP)
# Use:
#   2021005521               for FK via WireTap,
#   2021005521-nowiretap     for FK without WireTap,
#   Test                     for dummy consumer,
#   FKORG                    for development mode
